### Create the Database

```javascript
import RefinerDB from "refinerdb";

// OPTION 1: Just pass a database name
let refinerDB = new RefinerDB("my-db");

// OPTION 2: Pass a config
let dbConfig = {
    // How long to wait to reindex after data has changed
    indexDelay: 500,
    // A handler to fire when the State Machine transitions state
    onTransition: (newState) => console.log("Refiner DB State: " + newState);
}
let refinerDB = new RefinerDB("my-db", dbConfig);
```

### Define your indexes

What is the shape of your data? For any properties you want to filter/refine, you need to define an `IndexConfig`.

Imagine we had data that looked like this:

```javascript
let items = [
  { title: "one", id: 1 },
  { title: "two", id: 2 },
  { title: "four", id: 4 },
  { title: "three", id: 3 },
  { title: "one", id: 11 },
];
```

We would create a `RefinerDB` instance then setup two `IndexConfig` definitions, one for `title`, and one for `id`.

```javascript
import RefinerDB, { IndexType } from "refinerdb";

let refinerDB = new RefinerDB("my-db");
let indexDefinitions = [
  { key: "title", hashFn: (item) => item.title, type: IndexType.String },
  {
    key: "id",
    hashFn: (item) => item.id,
    type: IndexType.Number,
    skipRefinerOptions: true,
  },
];
refinerDB.setIndexes(indexDefinitions);
```

Here are the available `IndexType` options, as well as the full type definition of `IndexConfig`.

```typescript
export enum IndexType {
  String = "string",
  Number = "number",
  Date = "Date",
}

export interface IndexConfig {
  key: string;
  type: IndexType;
  hashFn: (item: any) => any;
  // For things like dates with timestamps, or really long strings, do you really need to calculate refiner option?
  skipRefinerOptions?: boolean;
}
```

## Query Syntax

To query, you create a `filter` object, where each each property on the object maps to a registered Index key.

In this example the are looking for movies where:

- `genre` is "Action" or "Comedy"
- `title` includes the text "day"
- `score` is greater or equal to 6

```javascript
let filter = {
  genre: ["Action", "Comedy"],
  title: "day*",
  score: { min: 6 },
};

// You then pass your filter to the query method inside the QueryCriteria object
let { items, refiners } = await refinerDB.query({ filter });
```

### Exact Equals

```javascript
// Find Action movies
let filter = { genre: "Action" };
```

You can pass multiple values to the to match on any they will be `OR`'d together.

```javascript
// Find movies with a genre of Action or Comedy
let filter = { genre: ["Action", "Comedy"] };
```

If you add multiple indexes to the filter, they will be `AND`'d together.

```javascript
// Find all Action or Horror movies rated PG-13
let filter = { genre: ["Action", "Horror"], mpaa: "PG-13" };
```

Number Indexes work the same way

```javascript
// Find anything with a score of exactly 7.1
let filter = { score: 7.1 };
```

### String contains

You can query string indexes using a 'contains' by including an `*` (asterisk) in your filter value.

```javascript
// Query a string Index by "contains". Put as asterisk at the end
//   Find any movies with 'day' anywhere in the title
let filter = { title: "day*" };
//   Find any movies with 'day' or 'night' anywhere in the title
let filter = { title: ["day*", "night*"] };
```

### Min / Max

You can query number and date indexes using a min/max range.

```javascript
// Find all movies with a score greater or equal to 7
let filter = {
  score: { min: 7 },
};

// Find all movies released in 2012 with score less than 5
let filter = {
  released: {
    min: new Date("1/1/2012"),
    max: new Date("12/31/2012"),
  },
  score: { max: 5 },
};
```
