# Installation

There are currently two main packagages in the RefinerDB ecosystem:

- [`refinerdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/refinerdb) - The core engine, usable in vanilla JS
- [`refinerdb-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/refinerdb-react) - A React wrapper for the core engine
  - If you use this package you don't need to include core `refinerdb`.

```sh
npm install refinerdb@next
```

or

```sh
npm install refinerdb-react@next
```
